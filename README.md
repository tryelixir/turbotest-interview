## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is your hiring process? When will I hear about next steps?

This take home assignment is the first step in our hiring process. **We review every take home assignment submission and promise to get back to you either way within one week.** 

From there, you‚Äôll have a technical interview going through your resume and some potential scenarios you‚Äôll encounter on the job
Finally, there will be a short conversation with our CEO to ensure you‚Äôre a good fit for the team


### How do you decide who to hire?

We evaluate candidates based on three criteria:

- Technical ability 
- Prior experience 
- Alignment with our values - people who are scrappy, optimistic, and customer obsessed (see more details on the job posting https://wellfound.com/l/2ABh8v)

This means whether we hire you is based on how you do during our interview process, not on your previous experience (or lack thereof).

### How can I help my application stand out?

We're looking for people who have high energy, are optimistic, scrappy, and willing to learn. If you are very excited about working here, please feel free to go above and beyond on this assignment.
